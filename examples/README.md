- High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models - The paper that introduced the approach behind Stable Diffusion.

- CLIP - CLIP learns to connect text with images and the CLIP text encoder is used to transform a text prompt into the rich numerical representation used by SD. See also, this article on OpenCLIP for some background on recent open-source CLIP variants (one of which is used for SD version 2).

- GLIDE: Towards Photorealistic Image Generation and Editing with Text-Guided Diffusion Models an early paper demonstrating text conditioning and CFG.
